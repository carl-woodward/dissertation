WHAT'S ON THE DISK?
_-_______________-_

There are three folders on this accompanying floppy disk.

RAW DATA - contains the original Html files generated by RegKit 1.0 from whence
	the results came.

REGKIT 1.0 - contains a single self-extracting executable containing RegKit and all
	of the runtime files required for RegKit to execute properly. Simply type in
	or browse to the folder which you would like to install RegKit and press UnZip.

	Once installed, simply navigate to where you installed RegKit and double click
	REGKIT.EXE.

	Uninstalling RegKit 1.0 is more difficult. Despite the aims of RegKit and this
	thesis, I have not yet written an uninstallation program. So, ironically, the
	files and Registry entries (only four) can only be removed by hand. To do
	so click START and Run. Type REGEDIT.EXE and Registry Editor will load. Delete
	the folder HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.djc and all the Registry entries will die. Delete
	the RegKit files you installed and any html or djc files it created. You are now
	clean.

	***DO NOT DELETE HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT*** I have told you which folder to remove and
	cannot be responsible for your entire Registry being destoyed.
	If you aren't sure dont delete anything, four registry entries will not seriously 
	hurt your machine.

SOURCE CODE - *.h, *.cpp, *.rc and *.reg files can be viewed with any text viewer.
	Alternatively, if you have Visual Studio 5 (compatability issues) or 6 then
	double click RegKit.dsw and the entire project will load.

	This source code is the property of Carl Woodward and the University of Nottingham
	Please do not alter it.
